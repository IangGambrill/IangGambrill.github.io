description: this project started with the intention of critiquing the culture of
  opulence i surround myself with. i am always buying and spending time with new things,
  leaving behind the old to melt together and be forgotten, left to melt in to an
  amorphous blob to be swallowed hole by the memory of the newest fun thing.
